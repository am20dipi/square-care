# SQUARE-CARE

SQUARE-CARE is a stimulating application that allows users to create, interact, view and delete SQUARES in a minimalist environment. 

SQUARE-CARE utilizes a Ruby on Rails backend and a frontend built on JavaScript, React framework and Redux middleware. 

## INSTALLATION
1. Download the repository from [github](https://github.com/am20dipi/square-care/blob/master/notes.md). 
2. Install gems with bundler.
3. Run rails db:migrate in the terminal (if necessary).
4. While in the backend directory, run command 'rails s' to run the server. 
5. Switch into the frontend directory and run 'open index.html' to open the browser view. 

## USAGE

After opening the browser and running the server, signup or login using the displayed buttons. Fill out the form successfully and be redirected to the user home page. Here, any previously created squares will be shown. One will be prompted to create a new square.
